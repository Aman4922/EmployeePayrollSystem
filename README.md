# 🏢 EmployeePayrollSystem

An **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** based Java application to manage employee details, calculate salaries, and generate payroll reports efficiently.  

## 📜 Overview

The **EmployeePayrollSystem** is designed to demonstrate the practical use of **OOP principles** such as:
- **Encapsulation** – Keeping employee data secure through private fields and getter/setter methods.
- **Inheritance** – Using parent-child class relationships to handle different types of employees.
- **Polymorphism** – Achieving flexibility in salary calculation using method overriding.
- **Abstraction** – Hiding implementation details of payroll calculation and exposing only necessary methods.

This project simulates a payroll system where the organization can:
- Store and manage employee details.
- Differentiate between employee types (full-time, part-time, contract).
- Calculate net salaries based on role-specific rules.
- Generate and display payroll reports.
